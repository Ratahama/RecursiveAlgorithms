# In Python, set() is a built-in data type
# that represents an unordered collection of unique elements.
# It is defined by enclosing a comma-separated sequence of elements
# inside curly braces {}. Here are some key characteristics of sets in Python


#  The N-Queens problem is a classic problem in which you need to place
#  N chess queens on an NÃ—N chessboard in such a way that no two queens
#  threaten each other.
